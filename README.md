# POWER-BI--HOSPITAL-EMERGENCY-ROOM-DASHBOARD
Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to monitor emergency room KPIs including patient inflow, wait times, triage levels, and resource utilization.  Enabled hospital staff to make real-time, data-driven decisions, improving operational efficiency and patient care outcomes.
To enhance operational efficiency and provide actionable insights into emergency room performance, we need to create a Hospital Emergency Room Analysis Dashboard in Power BI. This solution will enable stakeholders to track, analyze, and make data-driven decisions regarding patient management and service optimization.
